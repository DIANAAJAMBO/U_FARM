Shipping Address: If you're shipping physical goods, you'll need to collect the customer's shipping address. You can use input fields for the street address, city, state/province, postal code, and country.

Payment Information: You'll need to collect the customer's payment information to process their order. This can include credit/debit card information, PayPal information, or other payment methods. You can use input fields for the cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV code.

Order Summary: Before the customer submits their order, it's a good idea to show them a summary of their order, including the items they're purchasing, the quantity of each item, and the total price.

Submit Button: Finally, you'll need a submit button to allow the customer to submit their order. You can use a button element for this and add a JavaScript event listener to handle the submission of the form. -->
